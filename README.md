### Create a React-based single page app to perform searches against the Guardian content API and displays the results.

1. When the page is rendered at the start, it displays all the results of the API. Circular progress bar displays until the API finishes processing

2. Given the result of that API call it displays a list of results, grouped by the Section of the Guardian the items are found in.

3. The results for each item should show the Title, link and publication date (formatted as DD/MM/YYYY).

4. The search is performed during the process of user input the text, or when the user finishes input text, then press enter

5. When an item is pinned, it immediately appears below the search results.

### Pacakges used

React, axios, moment and redux
